We use NX as our monorepo tool. This means that we have a single repository that contains multiple projects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
For a PR and commits:
use semantic commit messages.
For example, "feat: add a new feature" or "fix: correct a typo".
Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
Use the body to explain what changes you have made and why you made them.
